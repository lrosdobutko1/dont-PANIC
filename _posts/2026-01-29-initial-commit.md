## A new developer blog?  
It's more likely than you think ...  
My name is Lawrence.  
I'm a recent college graduate with a fancy diploma, and allegedly a specialization in software development.  
It was either that, or hog tie myself with an ethernet cable and hide in a closet, because after several courses involving networking, I still don't understand what an SSL socket is.  
My intention, going forward, is to catalog my journey of learning to be a better software developer, and to document the *many* painful mistakes I will make as I go. Hopefully you, the reader, will fi[...]

I have no idea where this journey will take me, nor what I will do during each leg of the journey, but I will do my best to explain each new problem I encounter, as I encounter them, and how I go abou[...]
With any luck, hopefully someone later on will avoid making some of the mistakes I made, because they once read an obscure blog by a former welder.  
I intend to focus the majority of my learning on Game Maker Language (GML), Game Maker Studio's scripting language which is the engine I am using to create my first indie video game, "Robo Gauntlet". [...]
Buckle up because that will be a recurring theme here!  

This will not be a terribly insightful blog.  
You will not learn what it takes to balance on the cutting edge of technology.  
In fact, I will frequently trip over the cutting edge, and probably knock all of the good china off of the tables surrounding me.  
Don't ask why I'm surrounded by tables covered in good china. It's a whole thing ...  
But if you have any interest in watching someone fail repeatedly until there's literally no possible way to fail again (and then manage to find one more) before succeeding, then stick around.  
It might be entertaining, and I could use the company.  
The cats are getting sick of listening to all of my jokes, and I need a new audience.
